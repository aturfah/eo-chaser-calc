# EO Chaser Calculator

For Etrian Odyssey games, calculate the expected number of follow-up attacks for chaser-type skills.

Below I will provide an brief explanation of the arguments the page accepts.

- **Maximum Hits**: The upper limit of the number of follow-up attacks that can occur.
- **Chance Reduction**: The follow-up chance reduction after each successful chase.
- **Number of Attacks**
- - **Count**: The number of attacks that can cause a follow-up to occur. Must be whole numbers.
- - **Probability**: The probability of each number of attacks occurring. Either whole numbers (50%) or decimals (0.5).
- - _Note:_ The variable number of attacks is to allow skills like Swashbuckling which may activate any number of times. If you have a fixed number of attacks then type that number with probability 1.00.
